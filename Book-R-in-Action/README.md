# R in Action Study Notes
## Chapter 1
Chapter 1 begins with an introduction to R and the features that make it so useful as a data-analysis platform. The chapter covers how to obtain the program and how to enhance the basic installation with extensions that are available online. The remainder of the chapter is spent exploring the user interface and learning how to run programs interactively and in batches.

## Chapter 2
Chapter 2 covers the many methods available for getting data into R. The first half of the chapter introduces the data structures R uses to hold data, and how to enter data from the keyboard. The second half discusses methods for importing data into R from text files, web pages, spreadsheets, statistical packages, and databases.

## Chapter 3
Chapter, we review methods of creating graphs, modifying them, and saving them in a variety of formats.

## Chapter 4
Chapter 4 covers basic data management, including sorting, merging, and subsetting datasets, and transforming, recoding, and deleting variables.

## Chapter 5
Chapter 5 covers the use of functions (mathematical, statistical, character) and control structures (looping, conditional execution) for data management. We then discuss how to write your own R functions and how to aggregate data in various ways.

## Chapter 6
Chapter 6 demonstrates methods for creating common univariate graphs, such as bar plots, pie charts, histograms, density plots, box plots, and dot plots. Each is useful for understanding the distribution of a single variable.

## Chapter 7
Chapter 7 starts by showing how to summarize data, including the use of descriptive statistics and cross-tabulations. 

## Chapter 8
Chapter 8 introduces regression methods for modeling the relationship between a numeric outcome variable and a set of one or more numeric predictor variables. 

## Chapter 9
Chapter 9 considers the analysis of basic experimental designs through the analysis of variance and its variants. 

## Chapter 10
Chapter 10 focuses on how to determine the sample size necessary to detect a treatment effect of a given size with a given degree of confidence. 

## Chapter 11
Chapter 11 expands on the material in chapter 5, covering the creation of graphs that help you to visualize relationships among two or more variables. This includes various types of 2D and 3D scatter plots, scatter-plot matrices, line plots, correlograms, and mosaic plots.

## Chapter 12
Chapter 12 presents analytic methods that work well in cases where data are sampled from unknown or mixed distributions, where sample sizes are small, where outliers are a problem, or where devising an appropriate test based on a theoretical distribution is too complex and mathematically intractable. They include both resampling and bootstrapping approaches—computer-intensive methods that are easily implemented in R.

## Chapter 13
Chapter 13 expands on the regression methods in chapter 8 to cover data that are not normally distributed. The chapter starts with a discussion of generalized linear models and then focuses on cases where you’re trying to predict an outcome variable that is either categorical (logistic regression) or a count (Poisson regression).

## Chapter 14
Chapter 14 describes methods of transforming a large number of correlated variables into a smaller set of uncorrelated variables (principal component analysis), as well as methods for uncovering the latent structure underlying a given set of variables (factor analysis). The many steps involved in an appropriate analysis are covered in detail.

## Chapter 15
Chapter 15 considers modern approaches to the ubiquitous problem of missing data values. R supports a number of elegant approaches for analyzing datasets that are incomplete for various reasons. Several of the best are described here, along with guidance for which ones to use when and which ones to avoid.

## Chapter 16 
Chapter 16 wraps up the discussion of graphics with presentations of some of R’s most advanced and useful approaches to visualizing data. This includes visual representations of very complex data using lattice graphs, an introduction to the new ggplot2 package, and a review of methods for interacting with graphs in real time.
