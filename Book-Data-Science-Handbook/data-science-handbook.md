## As an aspiring Data Scientist

- **DJ PATIL**
  - Nobody just discovers you at a cafe and says "Hey, by the way you've writing on that piece of napkin you must be smart!" That's not how it works, you must put yourself in positions where somebody can actually take a risk on you, before they can give you that opportunity.
  - It first starts by providing you can do something that you can make something.
  - People make a mistake by forgetting that data science is a team sport.
  - Because of the pace at which the world changes, the only way to prepare yourself is by having that dynamic range.
  -  One of the first things I tell new data scientists when they get into the orginalization is that they better be the first ones in the building and the last ones out.
  - If you wac=tch kids running around a track, and the parents want to leave, the kids always answer, "One more! One more!" You watch an adult run laps, and they are thinking, "How many more do I have to do?"
  - I'm a firm believer in the apprentice model
  - If the narrative is wrong, it's your narrative to change.

- **HILARY MASON**
  - We're at a point where there are very few people who've spent years building data science organizations in a company or building data-driven products.
  - We see data in everything here. We have people in New York doing data work across every domain you can imagine. It's absolutely fascinating.
  - I do believe that data gives people the power to make better decisions, so the more people who have access to it, the better.
  - You're trying to make a really intense emotion or complex phenomenon and express it in a way that people will understand intuitively.
  - Startups are the perfect place where you have a product that's generating it's own data.
  - You've got an infinite list of questions you can look into -- how do you pick the ones that are going to have the biggest impact.
  - For each data project you're working on, you need to ask yourself these questions: what are you working on? How will I know when it'is done? What does it impact?
  - The things you can do when you're hiring is look for people who learn quickly, are really creative, are flexible, and who can work with your engineering team because that's where they're going to sit.
  - Go to places where you can learn things.
  - A lot of people are afraid to get started because they're afraid they're going to do something stupid and people will make fun of them. Yes, you will do something stupid, but people are actually nicer than you think and the ones who make fun of your don't matters.

- **PETE SKOMOROCH**
  - What he really wantd on his team was a MacGyver of Data Analysis who could work with data, write code in Java and actually implement the algorithms, do some statistics, and really have a good intuition of what would drive strategic objectives.
  - When giving advice on undergraduate coursework take as many physics and math classed as you can, but also learn some computer science.
  - The only way to level up was to do real coursework and be around people who were actually doing it.
  - If you go into management, I advise not giving up coding completely. Own a feature or something that keeps you in the loop.
  - One of the highest leverage things you can do right now is gain some engineering and computer science skills.
  - If you are coming out of school and you want to work on a data team, you need to find good mentors.
  - He says when most people are asked what their job is, they reply with their job title. But that's a very limited way to think about the role you play within a team or company.

- **MIKE DEWAR**
  - Essentially, leaving academia is a moment where you have to decide if you want to be a professor or not, and I think I'd already decided that was not quite what I wanted to do. I like coding and making things, but I don't enjoy taking all day, so that was the decision I made.
  - Make very rough, quick visualizations of what's in the data, starting with time series and histograms
  - As soon as someone hands you a data set or gives you access to a stream, the very first thing to do is to find an interesting variable in the data set and plot it.
  - A journalist will often assume that there is data associated with a story and will demand to see it.
  - We're thinking a lot lately about how to extract information from article data.
  - Code in public.

- **RILEY NEWMAN**
  - They placed so much value on the sense of camaraderie on the team. Looking back, I think this is the "secret sauce" of Airbnb's success.
  - More data beats better models; better data beats more data
  - When we ask other data scientists that question, we hear about technical skills like Python and programming. We don't hear as much about extracting actionable insights.
  - When I think back to the early days of Airbnb, we were able to squeeze a lot of growth out of a simple ratio. If I spent a month building a perfect model, I would have wasted 29 days.
  - So we've invested a lot in the structure of our data warehouse and the tools used for accessing it so that it's intuitive to people with less experience working with data.
  - Data is effectively a record of an action someone in your community performed, which represents a decision they made about what to do (or not do) with your product. Data scientists can translate those decisions to stories that others can understand
  - Good data science is more about the questons you pose of hte data rather than data munging and analysis.
